# WeatherSwiftUI

WeatherSwiftUI is an iOS weather app whose UI is similar to parts of the Yahoo! Weather app. It uses Combine to download weather info from DarkSky. [Deprecated]DarkSky requires that you get an API key, but it is free for low-use apps. Apple just bought Dark Sky and has stopped issuing API keys. So if you don't already have one this isn't going to be much use.
